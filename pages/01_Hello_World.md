## Portfolio

### Dragos Platform - Asset Inventory

Dragos Asset Inventory is a core feature of the Dragos Platform, providing complete visibility into operational technology (OT), IT, IoT, and IIoT assets across critical infrastructure environments. As an early UI owner, I helped design and mature the asset inventory experience from the ground up—introducing advanced filtering, life cycle management tools, dashboards, and performance optimizations to support complex industrial environments. The interface enabled defenders to quickly discover, classify, and prioritize assets and vulnerabilities, forming the foundation for threat detection and incident response workflows.

### ZephyrFlow - Full Stack Application

ZephyrFlow is a full-stack wind turbine maintenance tracking application built with Next.js, React, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. The app demonstrates modern architecture patterns including containerized development with Docker, API design with GraphQL, and interactive data visualization using Recharts. It models real-world operational workflows, allowing users to manage turbine data, monitor performance metrics, and visualize trends through dynamic dashboards.

### Cave Adventure Game - Passion Project

This Cave Adventure (CRT UI Game) is a retro-styled, text-driven adventure experience inspired by classic CRT terminals and early dungeon crawlers. Built entirely in TypeScript, the game features dynamic text input recognition, "3D-style" environmental rendering, and even a boss fight sequence. The UI evokes the look and feel of an old CRT display, blending nostalgic visuals with modern code to create an immersive, interactive experience. [Play it now!](https://dontsaycursewords.com/game)

The majority of my professional work has been delivered within licensed SaaS platforms and is not publicly available. My [GitHub](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/) features personal projects and experiments with modern frameworks and backend services. These projects reflect exploration and rapid iteration and are distinct from the standards and constraints of enterprise production systems. I am constantly exploring new technologies and building tools that solve real problems or satisfy my curiosity. I enjoy working across the stack and experimenting with different languages and architectures to better understand how systems fit together.

# Portfolio

Hi! I’m always working and tinkering with various languages. I love creating tools and programs for different hobbies and tasks. Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/PeterGrillot) for my current public repositories.

Some of my projects include:

- Full stack apps with [Next.js](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/sonopsis) and [Ktor/React](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/krud-app)
- [Web apps](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/sonopsis)
- [Single Page Applications (SPAs)](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/curses)
- [Web-based games](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/matrx)
- An [audio switching tool for Linux](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/switcher)
- A [MAME front-end](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/veranda) for my arcade

My page builder, [Webgen](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/webgen), was used to make this very site!

I designed this site, drawing inspiration from Brutalism, Art Deco and Vorticism. The featured illustration is [“The Sun and the Moon”: Paul Nash’s Genesis (1924)](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/paul-nash-genesis/), which is in the public domain.

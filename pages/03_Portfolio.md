# Portfolio

See my [Github page](https://github.com/PeterGrillot) for my current public repositories. I have made [full stack](https://bitbucket.org/petegrillot/ktor-example-project/src/main/) web apps, [SPAs](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/curses), [web based games](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/matrx), and even a [MAME front-end](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/veranda) for my arcade. My latest page builder, [Webgen](https://github.com/PeterGrillot/webgen) was used to make this very site!
